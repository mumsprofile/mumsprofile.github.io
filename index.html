        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hi! I'm Felix Boahen, an aspiring Biology major with a passion for Sports Science. I’m an international student from Ghana, and throughout my academic and personal journey, I’ve been driven by a deep curiosity for the biological sciences and a desire to make a positive impact in my community. I was the MVP of the Kumasi Academy Regional High School Soccer Championship, and I’m also passionate about helping others through my foundation, which provides meals to the needy.

            I co-founded a nonprofit organization with a close friend, focusing on feeding the homeless and needy on the streets of Ghana. Our mission is to ensure that no one goes to bed hungry, and we aim to provide more than just meals—we aim to restore hope and dignity.
