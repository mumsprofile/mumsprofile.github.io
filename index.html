            Hi! I'm Felix Boahen, an aspiring Biology major with a passion for Sports Science, which stems from my curiosity about life and enhancing athletic performance. My studies in biology will provide a deep understanding of human physiology, while my minor in sports science will focus on biomechanics and sports psychology. I’m an international student from Ghana, driven to make a positive impact in my community. I was the MVP of the Kumasi Academy Regional High School Soccer Championship and co-founded a foundation to provide meals to the needy.
